# Simulator-for-running-processes-according-to-different-scheduling-algorithms
A simulator that calculates the turnaround time according to different scheduling algorithms.

Input File Format:
The input file should contain the number of processes (numberOfProc) followed by the arrival time and computation time for each process. Each line represents a process and follows the format:

arrivalTime0,computationTime0
arrivalTime1,computationTime1
arrivalTime2,computationTime2
arrivalTime3,computationTime3
arrivalTime4,computationTime4
...
arrivalTimek,computationTimek

Output:
The output will consist of the average turnaround time (ATA) for every scheduling algorithm used:FCFS (First-Come, First-Served),LCFS (Last-Come, First-Served) (Non-Preemptive),LCFS (Last-Come, First-Served) (Preemptive), RR (Round Robin) and SJF (Shortest Job First).
